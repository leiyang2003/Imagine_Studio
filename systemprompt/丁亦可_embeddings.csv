1,"⼰并试图挽回旧爱，她报
名参加求职真⼈秀节⽬《职男职⼥》，凭借天⻢⾏空的表现意外夺冠，获得时尚公司
“AMAY（五⽉）”买⼿部的⼊职机会。 
零时尚基础的丁亦可进⼊残酷的买⼿⾏业，从“时尚值为负”的职场菜⻦起步，屡屡
碰壁。她与开⾼端定时装私铺《远》的精英买⼿**赵沫远**（杨仕泽饰）不打不相
识，两⼈成为欢喜冤家。赵沫远像导师⼀样“开⼩灶”教她时尚知识，⽽丁亦可凭借
惊⼈记忆⼒、刻苦钻研与不服输的精神逐步成⻓。 
剧情穿插职场竞争（与同事、对⼿的互撕）、⾏业内幕（设计师合作、采购限额、折
扣率等专业细节）、旧爱纠缠（前男友反复出现）、邻居互动（楼下杜修⻬开精品店
带来的⽇常摩擦），以及顶尖买⼿**雷欧**带来的三⻆关系疑云。最终，丁亦可从新
⼈蜕变为优秀买⼿，收获事业成功与真爱（与赵沫远修成正果），展现当代年轻⼥性
在职场与情感中的独⽴与成⻓。结局略显仓促，但主要冲突均有收束。

## 丁亦可 × 赵沫远关键感情线总结 
两⼈感情线是全剧核⼼CP，属于典型的**欢喜冤家 → 导师与学⽣ → 互相成就 → 
相爱**模式。从“互怼”到“互补”，经历职场碰撞、误会化解、情感升温，最终修成
正果。以下按剧情发展阶段提炼主要关键故事： 
1. **初遇与“孽缘”建⽴（前期：1-4集左右）**   
   丁亦可租住的房⼦正好在赵沫远⾼端买⼿店《远》的楼上。   
   两⼈因⼀系列邻居式“灾难”结缘：丁亦可晾⾐服掉内⾐砸到赵沫远头上、弄脏他

5,"丁亦可租住的房⼦正好在赵沫远⾼端买⼿店《远》的楼上。   
   两⼈因⼀系列邻居式“灾难”结缘：丁亦可晾⾐服掉内⾐砸到赵沫远头上、弄脏他

6,"，观众开始嗑到“发糖”。 
3. **误会与情感危机（中期⾼潮：13-18集左右）**   
   赵沫远因个⼈原因（涉及过去好友/恋⼈背叛、⽗⼦⽭盾等⼼结）多次接近顶尖买
⼿**雷欧**，并找丁亦可帮忙。   
   丁亦可产⽣严重误会：以为赵沫远喜欢雷欧，⾃⼰只是“⼯具⼈”或“备胎”。   
   她⼀度⾃卑退缩，认为⾃⼰“融⼊不了他们的世界”，甚⾄考虑放弃这段感情。   
   两⼈冷静分⼿，丁亦可把精⼒投⼊⼯作，赵沫远也反思⾃⼰忽略她的感受。这是感
情最低⾕，充满虐⼼与⾃我怀疑。 
4. **互相袒露⼼意与和解（后期：19-22集左右）**   
   赵沫远听从建议主动找丁亦可和好，解释误会（他接近雷欧多为⼯作/项⽬需要，
⽽⾮感情）。   
   两⼈敞开⼼扉：赵沫远袒露过去创伤（⽗⼦失和、被背叛等），丁亦可也分享⾃⼰
的不安全感。   
   他们开始真正**互相理解与⽀持**，感情从暧昧转为明确表⽩。   
   丁亦可深情表⽩⽚段成为⾼甜名场⾯。 
5. **事业与爱情双丰收（⼤结局：23-24集）**
